3.1. Translate the arithmetic expressions (3+4)×5 and 3+(4×5) into Scheme 
expressions, and into plumbing diagrams.

A: (* 5 (+ 3 4)), (+ 3 (* 4 5)).

3.2.  How many little people does Alonzo hire in evaluating each of the 
following expressions:

A: 3, 4, 9.

3.3. Each of the expressions in the previous exercise is compound. 
How many subexpressions (not including subexpressions of subexpressions)
does each one have?

A: 3, 4, 9.

3.4.  Five little people are hired in evaluating the following expression:

(+ (* 3 (- 4 7))
   (- 8 (- 3 5)))

Give each little person a name and list her specialty, the argument values
she receives, her return value, and the name of the little person to whom
she tells her result.

A: (Jessie, +, (* 3 (- 4 7) and (- 8 (- 3 5)),
(Sarah, *, 3 and (- 4 7), Jessie), (Chelsea, -, 8 and (- 3 5),
Jessie), (Diana, - , 4 and 7, Sarah), (Violet, -, 3 and 5, Chelsea).

3.5 Evaluate each of the following expressions using the result 
replacement technique:

(sqrt (+ 6 (* 5 2)))

(+ (+ (+ 1 2) 3) 4)  

A1: (sqrt (+ 6 (* 5 2)))
(sqrt (+ 6 10))
(sqrt 16)
(4)

A2: (+ (+ (+ 1 2) 3)  4)
(+ (+ 3 3) 4)
(+ 6 4)
(10)

3.6  Draw a plumbing diagram for each of the following expressions:

(+ 3 4 5 6 7)
 
(+ (+ 3 4) (+ 5 6 7))
 
(+ (+ 3 (+ 4 5) 6) 7)

A: N/A

3.7. Scheme returns the output: (1/3)

3.8. No clue.
