2.2. What is the domain of the vowel? function?

A: All numbers and letters.

2.3. One of the functions you can use is called appearances. Experiment
with it, and then describe fully its domain and range, and what it does.

A: The domain is all numbers, the range is only the number zero.
The function takes as it's input two numbers and outputs 0.

2.4 One of the functions you can use is called item. Experiment with
it, and then describe fully its domain and range, and what it does.

A: The domain is all numbers, words, and sentences. The range is the
same. The function takes as it's input a number, say N, and a sentence
or word. Depending on the type of the second input, the function
will output the Nth character if it is a word, or the Nth word if it
is a sentence.


2.5 List the one-argument functions in this chapter for which the type
of the return value is always different from the type of the argument.

A:  <=, <, =, >=, >, equal?, every, even?, last, number?, number-of-arguments,
odd?, vowel?.

2.6. List the one-argument functions in this chapter for which the
type of the return value is sometimes different from the type of 
the argument.

A: Count.

2.7.  Mathematicians sometimes use the term "operator" to mean a function
of two arguments, both of the same type, that returns a result of the same
type. Which of the functions you've seen in this chapter satisfy that 
definition?

A: +, -, /, *,  and, or, remainder, word.

2.8. An operator f is commutative if f(a,b)=f(b,a) for all possible arguments
A and B. For example, + is commutative, but word isn't. Which of the 
operators from Exercise 2.7 are commutative?

A: +, *, and, or.

2.9. An operator f is associative if f(f(a,b),c)=f(a,f(f(b,c)) for all
possible arguments A, B, and C. For example, * is associative, but not /
. Which of the operators from Exercise 2.7 are associative?

A:  *, +.
